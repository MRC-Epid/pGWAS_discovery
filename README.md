Code repository for Pietzner M, Wheeler E, et al. 2021 "Mapping the proteo-genomic convergence of human diseases" 

The code and scripts in this repository describes the core analysis done for the paper and other analysis described in the paper can easily derived from any of the scripts. Please keep in mind that this code has been written to run on the HPC system of the University of Cambridge and requires dedicated input files, which are not always sharable due to privacy reasons, e.g., individual level genotypes. While the authors are happy to answer questions, there will be no active maintenance of the code stored.
